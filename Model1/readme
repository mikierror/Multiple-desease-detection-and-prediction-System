covid_trained_model.sav : This is the Deployed trained model which we are making used in temp.py

generated_covid.csv : This is our covid dataset using which we have trained our model

model1.ipynb : This is the source code of the developed machine learning model
                we have not made use of this in project anywhere because, we have deployed 
                the trained model , we will be making use of this trained model.
                You can open this file in google colab to check the source code 
                and check how we have developed and deployed our model.

temp.py : This is the code used for predicting using the trained model.
